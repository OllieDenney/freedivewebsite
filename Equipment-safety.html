             <p>To be safe when freediving you have to keep three things in mind:</p>
                
             <ul>
                    <li>Be careful what gear you use using<br> (dive belts can be dangerous)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Always dive with a partner who has<br> around the same experience as you</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>Don't go past your limits</li><br>
            </ul>
        
            
            <p2><br>If you see someone pass out when freediving use these techniques<br></p2>
            <br>
            <ul>
                    <li>Place you hand under their chin or over their mouth <br>(at this point don't worry about the person inhaling air, this<br> cannot happen becuase their bodies into lockdown<br> and their airways shut)</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Place your other hand on their back</li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>Start to kick up to the surface</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>One you reach the surface alert <br>someone if you are alone</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Repeat their name over and over again, <br>if they do not awake or respond, <br>proceed to do mouth to mouth</li><br>
            </ul>
